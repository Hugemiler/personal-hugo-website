This project builds a machine-learning model to estimate infant biological age from metagenomic profiles collected worldwide.  
It reveals conserved developmental trajectories and provides a quantitative measure of gut ecosystem maturation.

**Highlights**
- Production-ready age model integrating >3,100 metagenomes from >1,600 participants 2-18 months old across 12 countries
- Validated model generalizes across geography to place diet on the spotlight as the main driving force
- The gut microbiome matures in diversity and functional redundancy, in a predictable way across the globe
