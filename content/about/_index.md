Hi, I'm **Guilherme Fahur Bottino**, a computational biologist, data scientist, and [educator](/teaching/) interested in how the human microbiome develops and interacts with the brain during early life. My [research](/research/) combines metagenomics, quantitative modeling, and developmental neuroscience to understand how microbial communities assemble, diversify, and synchronize with infant neurodevelopmental milestones.

I've had a deliberately nonlinear [career](/doc/Academic_CV_Bottino.pdf), moving fluidly between science, education, and technology. I began as a chemistry teacher in Brazil, where I trained students for Olympiads and university entrance exams, then expanded into educational publishing and psychometrics, developing large-scale assessments and reporting systems. Later, I founded my own startup company, providing consultation in data science and visualization for platforms that joined digital publishing, analytics, and learning science. I then returned to academia, initially as a computational chemist for my Masters and Ph.D., which revolved around biomolecular structural modeling. Later, I transitioned to computational biology, studying early-life microbiome and neurodevelopment. Across these roles, my focus has stayed the same: using data, design, and clear reasoning to make complex systems - whether human or microbial - interpretable, reproducible, and accessible.

Outside of the dry lab, I am an avid PC gamer and like to express myself through cooking, baking and above all, bartending.
